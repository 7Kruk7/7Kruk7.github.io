# Morse Code Locker System

### Overview 
We designed a security system utilizing a Morse code transmitter and receiver. The transmitter sends a character sequence from a primary laptop to a secondary machine acting as the receiver. The system compares the incoming signal against a pre-defined password; if the sequences match, the locker mechanism is unlocked.

### Purpose 
To gain practical experience with LabVIEW, the industry-standard software used by engineers for hardware integration and instrument control.
